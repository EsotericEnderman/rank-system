# Here you can add ranks. A typical configuration may look like this:
# Keep in mind, rank names have to be unique, but rank display names can be different.
# Want to sort ranks? You can add a letter corresponding to the ranks position, as by default, they are sorted alphabetically.
# For example: aowner, badmin, cmember, dguest.
# Don't worry about the names being ugly, they aren't displayed anywhere other than in the command autocomplete.
#ranks:
#  - name: aowner
#    # Names that will be displayed as prefixes in chat and in the tab-list.
#    displayName: "&4&lOwner" # Dark red and bold.

#    permissions:
